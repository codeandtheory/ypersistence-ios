    /// in that case should be called from a non-blocking thread.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - entity: Core Data entity to save to
    ///   - models: Array of models that will be converted into Core Data records and saved.
    ///   - shouldOverwrite: If `true` all existing records for this entity will be deleted
    ///   and new records matching `models` will be inserted.
    ///   Use `true` for example on pull-to-refresh, when fetching the 1st page of results,
    ///   or whenever you need to account for remote deletes.
    ///   If `false` no local records will be deleted, any existing matching records will be updated,
    ///   any local duplicates will be removed, and new records will be inserted.
    ///   Use `false` when fetching additional subsequent pages of results, or
    ///   whenever `models` is a subset of the total data.
    ///   - context: Optional managed context to use. Default = nil.
    ///   If nil a short-lived `workerContext` will be created.
    ///   Either way `saveChangesAndWait()` will be called on the context.
    ///   Typically you would just pass `nil` unless you specifically need to control which
    ///   context the records are inserted into.
